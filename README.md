# todo-list

This is a Todo List website made for the Odin Project.

It's the first website I made with mobile-first design in mind. It uses HTML, CSS and Javascript. It utilizes webpack and date-fns library. 

The features are:
* Ability to add & edit todos (surprise)
* Done and priority status
* Projects
* Responsiveness
